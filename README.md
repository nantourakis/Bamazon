## Description

This application uses Node.js & MySQL to implement a command line based storefront.<br/>
<br/>
The interface allows the user to view the current inventory of store items: item IDs, descriptions, department in which the item is located and price. The user is then able to purchase one of the existing items by entering the item ID and the desired quantity. If the selected quantity is currently in stock, the user's order is fulfilled, displaying the total purchase price and updating the store database. If the desired quantity is not available, the user is prompted to modify their order. <br/>
<br/>
I've built this app with the help of the following npm packages: <br>
<ul>
<li>npm inquirer (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)</li> 
<li>npm mysql (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)</li> 
<li>npm colors (https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors)</li>
<li>npm cli-table https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-table</li>
<ul>
